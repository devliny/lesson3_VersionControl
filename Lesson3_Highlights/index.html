            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a very important feature in the world of programming and web app development. When building a program, or using any sort of code to make anything (whether it be a program, or a web page, or using any sort of language) there must be a way to modify it and save changes. This is important, but a much more convenient feature, one that could save you from hours of troubleshooting, and streamline your workflow process, is the ability to revert to old stages in your work. Version Control is a way to do this without having to create a whole bunch of saved files and organize them yourself.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is not limited to just one professional service. Many people have taken it upon themselves to construct a platform for version control. Git is just one of those. Git uses a unique formula for version control. As opposed to saving different versions of a file, Git uses snapshots to link back to local file repositories on oneâ€™s computer. Giving users a local experience, as well as using snapshots to construct past versions of a project makes this process incredibly smooth and fast.This method is much more advantageous compared to other version control services due to its high speeds, friendly interface, and widespread adoption.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Three Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git implements a three stage process. This process makes it almost impossible to lose any date a user could possibly have wanted to save. The three states are as follows: committed, modified, and staged. The committed state means a user has decided to commit the changes they have made to their project and it is stored in their local database. The modified stage means that users have made changes to the project and have not decided to save it yet. If a file is in the modified state it is not saved in any way. A staged file means that a user has marked it to be saved in its current version and it will go into your next commit snapshot.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">As I mess around with Git I am pretty blown away by how user friendly it is. This whole process is incredibly streamlined. The command shortcuts make using the this version control software incredibly fast and much easier than trying to save different versions of a file and keep them organized. Implementing this practice is actually teaching me a lot more than just reading about it because inputting the commands and seeing how it affects the outcomes clearly breaks down how this service work and makes accessing past versions of ones work much easier.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is a git repository. It is the largest git repository host on the internet and serves as the host for millions and millions of projects. The repository is an essential step in the git process. Without a repository, one would not have a place in which to store snapshots of their work in progress. Another essential tool regarding GitHub is that it can serve as a point of collaboration. One of the largest advantages of Git is its ability to be used by many individuals working and making changes to the same project. This point of collaboration tool makes it incredibly useful in the real world when working on development teams.</p>
